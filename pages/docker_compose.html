# Docker Compose

Docker compose compiles a configuration file into an "app" consisting of any number of containers that can interact with one another.

* `docker-compose.yaml`
* `docker-compose.json`

## Common commands
* All entries prefixed with `docker-compose`
* Long form parameter names used (many also have a short form)

| Command or Parameter | Description |
| -------------------- | ----------- |
| --file {name} | (-f) specify a docker-compose file (instead of default "docker-compose.yaml"). Also allows JSON. | 
| --detach | (-d) runs all containers in the background |
| up   | starts all containers in the docker-compose file |
| down    | tear down the app, stop & remove containers and networks |
| start {container} | start a specific container in the app |
| stop {container}  | stop a specific container in the app |
| pause   | pause all containers in the app |
| unpause | unpause all containers in the app |
| exec {container} {command} | run a command inside a named container |
| build   | build containers for the app |
| config  | check whether a YAML file is correctly structured |
| logs    | show the logs for the app |
| top     | see an overview of containers and their wrapped processes |


## Example docker-compose file
```
version: "3.8"

# then specify three different services (python, mysql, ubuntu)
services:
	python:
		image: python:3
		container_name: my_py
		volumes:
			- .:/src
		command: python3 /src/run.py
		restart: always
	mysql:
		image: mysql:latest
		container_name: my_mysql
		environment:
			- MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=abc123
			- SOME_OTHER_VARIABLE=asd345
		restart: always
	ubuntu:
		image: ubuntu:latest
		container_name: my_ubuntu
		command: echo "Hello from Ubuntu"
		restart: always
```




### Docker Compose

* a helper for building apps that consist of multiple containers (microservices)
* app architecture is defined in a single YML file (or a JSON file)
* services are automatically assigned to the same network, you don't need to specify a new network name
* the "restart" option tells Docker to automatically restart the service if there's a crash
* if services are built in the foreground, composer will print container output as they build
* with each print, the docker name is prefixed before the message.
* use the `-d` flag to build the app in the background (suppresses build messages)
  
Here is an example YAML file (docker-compose.yml)
```
# the first line is the Docker Compose version
version: '3'

# then specify three different services (python, mysql, ubuntu)
services:
	python:
		image: python:3
		container_name: my_py
		volumes:
			- .:/src
		command: python3 /src/run.py
		restart: always
	mysql:
		image: mysql:latest
		container_name: my_mysql
		environment:
			- MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=abc123
			- SOME_OTHER_VARIABLE=asd345
		restart: always
	ubuntu:
		image: ubuntu:latest
		container_name: my_ubuntu
		command: echo "Hello from Ubuntu"
		restart: always
```

Build the app with Docker Compose. 
```
docker-compose up
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose ps
docker-compose down
```
