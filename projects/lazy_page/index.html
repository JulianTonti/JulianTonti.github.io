# Lazy Page

Browsers work hard to render badly structured HTML correctly.

Let's be lazy and use that ';..;'

* start a blank HTML file
* add this line at the top: `<script type="module" src="https://julians.page/js/head.js?"></script>`
* now write the rest of the file using Markdown
* view in the browser

We're relying on the browser to fix our laziness correctly. It usually works.
