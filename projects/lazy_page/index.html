# Lazy Page

Browsers work hard to render badly structured HTML correctly.

Let's be lazy and use that ';..;' Totally dodgy I know; we're hacking here.

* start a blank HTML file
* add this line at the top: `<script type="module" src="https://julians.page/js/lazy_page.js"></script>`
* now write the rest of the file using Markdown
* view in the browser

We're relying on the browser to fix our laziness correctly. It usually works.

For example, the source for this page looks like this:

```
<script type="module" src="https://julians.page/js/lazy_page.js"></script>
<title>Lazy Page</title>
