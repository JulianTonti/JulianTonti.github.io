# Using GitHub Pages without Jekyll

You can use GitHub Pages to host websites. Read about it here: [https://pages.github.com/](https://pages.github.com/). By default, Jekyll will be enabled and GitHub will process your content automatically when you push to the repo. That's fine, but maybe you want to control your own build process.

## Create a site without Jekyll
* using your GitHub username, create a repo called `<username>.github.io`
* add an empty file to the repo root named `.nojekyll`. This will disable GitHub's automatic Jekyll processing and put you in control of your build process (if you even have one).
* add an `index.html` to the repo then visit `<username>.github.io` to see it.

## Using a custom domain
* visit your custom domain provider setup a CNAME to point at your github address
* create a file named `CNAME` in the root of your repo. It should contain your custom domain.
* visit your custom domain in a browser and it should forward to your GitHub Pages site
