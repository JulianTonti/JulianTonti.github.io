# Using GitHub Pages without Jekyll

When you use [GitHub Pages] to host a website, [Jekyll] will be enabled by default and GitHub will run a build pipeline automatically when you push to the site's repo. That's fine, but maybe you want to control your own build process (or not use one at all).

## Create a site without Jekyll
* using your GitHub username, create a repo called `<username>.github.io`
* add an empty file to the repo root named `.nojekyll`. This will disable GitHub's automatic Jekyll processing.
* add your site content then visit `<username>.github.io` to see it.

## Using a custom domain
* go to your custom domain provider and create a CNAME record that points at `<username>.github.io`.
* add a text file named `CNAME` to the root of your site's repo. The file should contain your custom domain.
* go to your site's repo at GitHub, then `Settings &rarr; GitHub Pages &rarr; Enforce HTTPS` and ensure that it is ticked.
* visit your custom domain and it should forward to your GitHub site (it may not be immediate).
